### Hi there üëã
**My name is Seiyeon Cho!**
I'm a growing developer who study and code hard.
As a result I want to give positive influence to other people, both developers and customers, as much as possible
using trending skills and with eminent fellows.
I'm currently trying both system and backend track, preparing to select one of those in 2024 Winter.
